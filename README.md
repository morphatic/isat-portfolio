# Application for Promotion to Professor

First of all, _**thank you very much**_ for spending the time and energy to evaluate my application and portfolio. Having served on the PAC, I know how time-consuming, and sometimes stressful, this process can be. As such, I hope you'll find this application to be well-organized, and clearly articulated. I hope to make it easy for you to reach the conclusion that I have indeed earned the rank of Professor in the Department of Integrated Science & Technology.

## Organization

The portfolio is organized as follows:

* **[Overview](/README.md)**<br>Connects the dots. Articulates how the total is greater than the sum of the parts. The document you're reading now.
* **[Teaching Section](teaching.md)**
 * **[Teaching Narrative](teaching_narrative.md)**<br>My teaching philosophy and the evolution of my craft as an instructor highlighting major lessons learned.
 * **[Teaching Evidence](teaching_evidence.md)**<br>Links to supporting resources organized according to the PAC guidelines.
* **[Scholarship Section](scholarship.md)**
 * **[Scholarship Narrative](scholarship_narrative.md)**<br>Shows how all of the puzzle pieces fit together, and tells the story of my contributions to knowledge.
 * **[Scholarship Evidence](scholarship_evidence.md)**<br>Links to supporting resources organized according to the PAC guidelines.
* **[Service Section](service.md)**
 * **[Service Narrative](service_narrative.md)**<br>Making clear how I've applied my gifts in service to JMU and the broader community.
