# Service on Departmental Committees

I have put a great deal of time and effort into service at the departmental level. I should hope that there is no question about my commitment to the continuous improvement of both our Department and the BSISAT Program. I'd like to focus on some of my more important contributions.

## BSISAT Assessment Committee

I have been a member of Assessment since 2007, and became the Chair in Fall 2016. Some of my notable contributions over the years include:

* **Led the creation of Goal K, the "Integration" goal**<br>When I arrived in ISAT in 2006, the program was still struggling very much with the operational definition of the question "What is _integration_?" During the Spring 2008 semester, I led the committee that wrote Goal K:
> **ISAT Graduates are integrated problem solvers who look out from the perspective of a problem and then assemble the tools and knowledge needed to solve it**
* 

Here is a brief list of committees on which I served and some of my contributions in the time period prior to receiving tenure and promotion to associate professor level.

* **Web Advisory Committee, Chair, 2008-2011:** authored the website architecture for all CISAT departmental and program websites prior to the adoption of Cascade as the university's content management system
* **IKM Academic Team, 2006-present:** served as chair 2009-2011 and 2013-present
* **Recruiting Committee, 2006-2013**, served as chair Fall 2009-2012; created the ISAT Video Contest (the ["It's ISAT!" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCSyCJIUDfc) has received over 23K views!!!)
* **C&I Committee, 2006-2012:**, IKM Representative
* **Foundations Committee, 2008-2014:** wrote and submitted an updated CAR for ISAT 252; served as the IKM Team representative
* **Assessment Committee, 2007-present:** in charge of research and development for a departmental portfolio system
* **SCOTS Academic Team, 2006-present:** somewhere in the middle it became the "Social Context" team. I seldom teach an explicitly social context course, so I'm not always super active, but I have used this group to help seed ideas for change in the program and department
* **Integration Committee, chair Spring 2008:** led committee to successfully accepted authoring of BSISAT Program Goal K
* **ISAT Golf Challenge Committee, Fall 2007-2011:** responsible for setting up and maintaining the website and liaison to IHS
* **ISAT Program and Departmental Faculty Meeting Minutes Taker, 2006-2014:** while I originally began taking notes to help myself learn names and faces, I served in this unofficial role for almost 8 years, transforming into a formal position when asked by Eric Maslen
* **IKM Faculty Search Committee, Fall 2008-Spring 2009:** resulted in successful hire of Nicole Radziwill
* **Biosystems Faculty Search Committee, Spring 2010:** not an official member but attended all talks and provided written feedback to the committee chair
