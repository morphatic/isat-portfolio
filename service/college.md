# Service on College-level Committees

I have not been asked, nor contributed a great deal of time or effort at the college level. The majority of my effort has been either at the Department/Program level or at the University level. Here are the committees on which I've served.

* **CISE IT Committee 2016-present**
* **CISAT Digital Measures Course Response Evaluation Team, 2007-2008**
* **CISAT International, 2007-2008:** assisted with analysis of CISAT-I website redesign
* **Computer Science Faculty Search Committee, 2008-2009**
