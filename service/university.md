# Service on University-level Committees

Over the years, I have had the opportunity to become increasingly active at the university level. I am in my sixth year on the JMU Faculty Senate, and my fifth year as the Chair of the Academic Policies Committee (APC) and on the Senate Steering Committee. As a result of having served in those roles for so long, I feel I've been able to use my talents to make a significant impact on JMU as a whole. I'll be more specific below.

## Other University-Level Service

* **Provost's Task Force on Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET), 2011-2012:** This group of about 20 faculty from across JMU made a thorough study of all of the various SET instruments used around JMU, and made recommendations about the direction JMU should go. I was the primary author of the report produced by my subcommittee, and this has been used in ISAT in our current SET instrument development efforts.
* **Provost's Madison Institute on Academic Rigor, 2012:** I was one of 34 faculty from across JMU to participate in this 2-day workshop that [resulted in a number of specific recommendations for enhancing the level of appropriate challenge that our students encounter](https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/wm_library/MadisonInstituteFinal.pdf).
* **CFI TAP Consultant, 2007-2013:** This actually was a role that was particularly influential in helping me hone my own pedagogy, and also allowed me to have an impact on the pedagogy of colleagues from across JMU.

* **JMU Web Strategy Consulting with JMU PR Office, 2009-2010**
