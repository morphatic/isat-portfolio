# Weekly Self-Evaluations

As a part of the _Integrating Developmental Instruction in Sustainability Context into an Undergraduate Engineering
Design Curriculum_ grant that I was a Co-PI on with Eric Pappas (funded: $431,202), we developed an approach to
fostering intentional self-development among students by metaphorically holding a mirror up to their faces. The
process works by first asking students to articulate an "ideal" version of themselves, their vision of who their
perfect selves would be. Second, we asked students to do a frank self-evaluation and indicate who they are right
now. The cognitive dissonance between the "real" and "ideal" selves was almost always enough to motivate them
to undertake some sort of intentional self-development project.

I built an automated system whereby each week each student received a **personalized** survey that asked them to:

1. Set 5 personal course-related goals for the week
2. Set an intention for how much time they planned to spend outside of class
3. Assess how well they accomplished the previous week's goals and time spent
4. Reflect on ways to improve their performance.

[**Here is an example of the weekly survey from one of my classes.**](https://jmu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_0enJneWblGTb1Tn)

The automated system would send them an email at the same time each week and aske them to fill out the survey.
The goals from the previous week were automatically populated in the new survey each week and were completely
personalized to the student. This required custom programming, use of the Qualtrics API and integration into
my own personally-hosted Wordpress websites.

I could use the weekly self-evaluations to keep track of which students were staying on top of the class. For
those students who were slacking off or falling behind, I could follow up with them personally to find out why
they weren't taking full advantage of the learning opportunity provided by the semester.

I don't think any sort of personal coaching system like this exists anywhere in education. The major downside of
the system was that it took quite a bit of energy for me to read the students' responses and figure out which
ones needed follow-ups. If I had more time to develop a system like this, I think it could foster quite a bit
of meaningful student learning and development.
