# Departmental Course Evaluations

## The "New" ISAT Course Evals

[**All course eval data can be downloaded from the appendix.**](/supporting_materials/evals.md)

The foundational premise of the **new** SIS student evaluation of teaching instrument [as described in a presentation
I gave to the department in August 2017](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1sqpng7O4J4KQ_20avlfxZZAeW46iemayIIjF86dEKiE/edit?usp=sharing) is as follows:

> The data from student evaluations of teaching are designed to be used by the instructor in the 
construction of a narrative, whether for annual evaluation, or during preparation of an application 
for promotion and/or tenure that speaks to the quality of instruction as it is evolving over time.

After my first semester of data, here was my analysis. **Please take these analyses with a grain
of salt since this is still a VERY new instrument**:

> Most of the histograms looked the same. If a histogram stood out as starkly different from others, 
I flagged that one for more scrutiny, both within and between courses. For example, on question #6 
("Understood how each topic fit into the course"), in one class 12 out of 13 responded Frequently/Always, 
whereas in another only 11 out of 18 gave it the same rating. This suggests I'm doing much better at 
contextualizing the content in the first course compared to the second. 

> On the other hand, for question #8 ("Found ways to apply the course content in a meaningful way"), 16 
out of 18 responded Frequently/Always in the second course compared to only 9 out of 13 in the first. 
Taken together, I could say that in the first course, students typically knew how the topics fit into 
the grand scheme even if they didn't always have a way to apply the knowledge. In the second course, 
students immediately saw the practical applicability of the individual topics but weren't quite as sure 
how all of the topics fit together.

> As it turns out, the first course was ISAT 340 (software development) and populated more by juniors, and 
the second course was ISAT 345 (software engineering) and had more seniors. ISAT 340 is much more "structured"
in that students are being guided through the steps of developing software, so it's reasonable that they
understand how the steps all fit together, even if they don't have any immediate practical use for those
steps. In contrast, the 345 students are in a situation where they're being shown the principles of agile
software development process, but they have to figure out for themselves how to apply it to a very specific
problem. Therefore, they see things as more practical, but can't yet see the big picture. The seniors are
also usually in the middle of interviewing for jobs and see the 345 content as practical because they are
being asked about it in interviews.

> Although rare, I treated "Hardly Ever" ratings as red flags that indicated areas I should watch out for in 
the future. For example, in 340, I had one or two students who reported "Hardly Ever" for questions 2, 3, 
6, and 9. Taken together, that suggests a student who was not very engaged with the course. I checked the 
CSV to see if the ratings belonged all to a single person; turns out they did not, and so the 
"dissatisfaction" was more diffuse and spread out, and perhaps less attributable to something thematic 
that I might want to tackle. If all of the negative ratings had been associated with a particular person, 
I might try to reflect on how I might better have been able to reach that student.

> The Control/Motivation questions showed that even though most people didn't have a choice about whether or 
not to take the class (#5), they expected that they would do well (#1) and ended up highly valuing the 
material (#6). Assuming they were honest, they spent only about half of the time outside of class that I 
hoped they would (#7). There was some dissatisfaction with how prepared they felt (#4), which is partly my 
fault since I teach the pre-requisites to both of these classes.

> The open-ended feedback added more color to the above analyses.  Given the above analyses as measured over 
a number of years, I believe that I could construct a convincing narrative that I have been a diligent and 
conscientious instructor. I believe that comparing values across courses had great value, and it might even 
be better if I had, say, departmental data as a comparison.

> Given the above analyses, I think I could be a bit more conscientious about making sure students understand 
how topics fit together, or, barring that, support them as they work to figure out how to construct their 
own puzzle. I could also do more to help students discover the relevance and value of the content.

After looking at my Spring 2018 responses for ISAT 252, it appears that students are still struggling to be
disciplined enough to work on assignments diligently throughout the semester rather than putting everything
off until the last minute. I think the struggle for me is finding the appropriate balance between relaxed 
and laid back and scary and threatening. Some students would clearly prefer if I put a bit more pressure on 
them to perform.

I was flattered that one student said: "Morgan is the best professor at JMU." (ISAT 252--Spring 2018--Section 2)

## The "Old" ISAT Course Evals

[**All course eval data can be downloaded from the appendix.**](/supporting_materials/evals.md)

Key points in this section:

* The overall mean (2011-2016) is 4.13 out of 5
* 80% of my ratings were either a 4 or 5
* Highest scores: #6 (concern and respect), #9 (fair and impartial), #5 (answers questions), #8 (helps outside class)
* Lowest scores: #14 (value of homework), #10 (timely feedback)
* Student evaluations are consistently normally distributed (**_not_** bimodal)

### Overall Scores By Year, Semester, and Course

The chart below shows the cumulative frequency of students' responses on my course evaluations 
across all of my courses from 2011-2016. The "a5" bar represents the "strongly agree" response 
category, which is the most positive, while "e1" is the most negative response. The actual 
numbers are, from left to right, 46%, 33%, 15%, 5%, 1%. In short, the overwhelming response to
my teaching has been positive (79%) with 94% being at worst neutral. Only 6% of responses were
negative.

![Cumulative Frequency of Student Evaluations](/assets/evals_cumulative_frequency.png)

The next two charts demonstrate that the overall response pattern has remained consistent from 
year to year. (**NOTE:** Shorter bars in the charts below does NOT mean lower scores. It only
means there were fewer responses, since the bars represent the absolute frequency of responses
in any particular category. The key thing to focus on is the distribution of scores.)

![Student Evaluations by Year](/assets/evals_by_year.png)

![Student Evaluations by Year](/assets/evals_by_year2.png)

Likewise, there is a similar pattern semester to semester.

![Student Evaluations by Semester](/assets/evals_by_semester.png)

The outlier in the above charts is the Fall 2015 semester. The straightforward explanation
for the more uniform distribution of responses in this semester was a dramatic shift in how I 
began to conduct assessment in my classes. In the Fall 2015 semester, I switched from the
choose-your-own-grade pedagogy that I had used from Fall 2011 to Spring 2015, and began using the
points-accumulation strategy that I have employed since then. The story behind this change 
is told in the [choose-your-own-grade section](/teaching/cyog.md) of this portfolio.

The normal distribution of student responses showing an overwhelmingly positive response
to my teaching holds when scores are looked at by course. Again, the bars in the chart below
represent absolute frequencies, so the high bars for ISAT 252 just indicates that I've had
A LOT more 252 students over the years than any other course.

![Student Evaluations by Course](/assets/evals_by_course.png)

### Overall Scores By Question

While the response patterns across the whole instrument described above tell a general 
story about students' positive evaluation of my courses, there is probably more value 
to be gained by looking at the response patterns on a question-by-question basis. Note,
that I seldom, if ever, use a textbook or give traditional exams in my courses, so I have 
not reported on the scores for questions #13 and #15 which address those aspects of a course.
The first chart in this section shows the overall response patterns for each question
over the entire time period 2011-2016.

![Student Evaluations by Question](/assets/evals_by_question1.png)

Clearly, the most positive response is to question #6 (_The instructor shows concern and respect 
towards students_). Nearly tied for second most positive are questions #9 (_The instructor is fair 
and impartial_) and #5 (_The instructor acknowledges all questions insofar as possible_). Almost
as high as these is #8 (_The instructor is effective in helping students outside of class_). All
together, these four questions tell a story that I'm **_extremely_** proud of. I absolutely want
to be known as a professor who is kind, respectful, helpful, fair, and a good listener.

This desire is not just vanity. [Self-Determination Theory (SDT)](http://selfdeterminationtheory.org/) 
is a psychological theory of motivation that holds that intrinsic motivation (which has been
demonstrated to be far superior to extrinsic motivation in fostering deep learning) is associated with:

* **Autonomy**--choice over what you do, when you do it, and how you are evaluated for it
* **Relatedness**--a sense of kinship both to people (instructor, classmates) and to the content
* **Competence**--a feeling of mastery which can apply to small nuggets as well as broad content areas

I intentionally build a sense of relatedness with my students by being kind, available, open,
helpful, and non-judgmental. I communicate respect for students by giving them autonomy over 
how they spend their time in my courses (within specified boundaries), letting them know that I 
trust them to spend their time wisely. I've been working for years to develop pedagogy that
maximizes the opportunity for students to chart their own course without blowing through the 
guardrails.

The two questions with the lowest responses are #10 (_The instructor gives timely feedback on student
peformance_) and #14 (_Homework is a valuable tool for learning the course material_). There is a
good reason why these questions have the lowest scores, but first let's look at two other 
representations of the per-question data to help get some more insight:

![Student Evaluations by Question](/assets/evals_by_question2.png)

![Student Evaluations by Question](/assets/evals_by_question3.png)

In the first chart above, each dot represents a single student response. The vertical location 
represents the mean response value for all responses on that question for that course. Since 
there are roughly 500 responses per question, a small amount of noise, or "jitter," has been 
added so that information is not hidden by overlapping dots. Note that the vertical axis does
not start at zero, so the "low" values are not as low as they appear. The second chart above shows the 
box plot for each question. The heavy horizontal line in the middle of the box represents the 
median (50th percentile). The top and bottom of the box represents the 1st and 3rd quartiles 
(25th and 75th percentiles). The thin lines extending from the top and bottom of the box represents
the minimum and maximum (0th an 100th percentiles). Any dots represent outliers, which are 
greater than 1.5 times inter-quartile range away from the median.

As you can see from these representations, even for my "low" scoring questions (#10 and #14), 
the median scores are at or near 4 out of 5 on the scale, and in all cases the minimums are
above a mean of 3. #10 is pulled down by one particularly low outlier. As it turns out, the 
outlying scores on question #10 come from Fall 2015 and Spring 2016. These were in the two 
semesters after I switched away from CYOG and to my new points-accumulation strategy and I 
was still figuring out how to do it effectively. By Fall 2016, these scores were beginning 
to return to be more in line with the rest of the scores.

### Addressing the Written Feedback

While the written comments on the departmental evaluation forms were not anywhere near as
informative as the [3-5 page exit essays I received from each student](/teaching/narratives.md), 
I still read them and attempted to respond to them with updates to my pedagogy in successive
semesters. Let's start with the number one comment that I got.

#### #1 "There needs to be more structure!!!"

Put nicely, students provided comments such as:

> Benton is an awesome guy and I like the theory behind the way the class
is setup, but I feel like I would get more out of the class if there was more 
structure. (ISAT 252--Spring 2013--Section 2)

Put less nicely:

> It's incredibly easy useless class. [sic] Professor brings no value to education. Terrible 
representation of the ISAT major. (ISAT 440--Spring 2016--Section 1)

A number of students suggested (both in writing, and during our face-to-face interviews) that
there should be more "structure" to the class. This puzzled me because I had [very detailed
syllabi](/supporting_materials/syllabi.md), and in most semesters, each student was required 
to complete a personalized, weekly survey in which they laid out their plans and goals for the
week and evaluated how well they had done on the previous week.

Eventually what I discovered is that by "structure," students were asking for due dates. They 
found that when given the freedom to work on tasks of their own choosing at their own pace, 
they did not have enough discipline to make wise use of their time. In more recent semesters,
I've found a couple of strategies for addressing this issue.

The first strategy for getting students to be more disciplined about using their time is to 
force them to make regular presentations to the class. These are typically very short (3-5 minutes
each), but since each student has to get up in front of the class and explain what they've
been doing and why it was worth spending their time on, the fear of appearing lazy or like a
"slacker" keeps them productive. If kept short, presentations only consume 1-2 class meetings
every 3 weeks or so.

The second strategy is to put a cap on the number of points a student can earn in a week. I 
was finding that with my new points-accumulation strategy, students were putting off working
on their badges until the end of the semester. They would be industrious for the first 4-6 weeks 
of the semester, then plateau, then scramble in the last 1-2 weeks to make up for lost time.
Not only was this not fun for anyone, but it also resulted in poorer work, poorer learning,
and poorer outcomes. By telling students up front that they cannot earn more than 15 points
in a week, it forces them to spread their point earning out over more weeks of the semester.
I've only had one semester in which to pilot this strategy, and so far the results seem
promising.

In short, with the new badges/points-accumulation system ([see my teaching narrative for a
description](/teaching/teaching_narrative.md)), coupled with regular class presentations and
a weekly cap on points, students feel like they have enough "structure" to keep them motivated
to perform consistently throughout the semester. At the same time, I'm still able to preserve
enough autonomy so that student passion can get a foothold. It's a difficult balance to 
achieve and I'm still working to fine tune it.

#### #2 "More timely feedback, please!"

Put nicely:

> Great course! I learned _a lot_ in not very much time. I feel like the grading scale is off. 
I spent more time on each assignment than was anticipated by the professor. (e.g. 20 hours on
mid-level CSS, rather than 10...) Timely feedback would benefit the class :)

One of the downsides of letting each student choose to work on whatever course-related thing 
they would like to is that it makes providing rich feedback more of a challenge. Since I didn't
have everyone turning in a similar assignment on the same day, I didn't have nice orderly stacks
of tests or quizzes or essays that I could take home and mark. Instead, I would get different
kinds of work at different intervals from many students. From some students I would get almost 
nothing at all. It was difficult to keep track of all of it.

One of the nice things about computer programming is that it's relatively easy even for a 
total beginner to know whether or not their program works. As such, a lot of the feedback is
immediate and very clear. That being said, when students get stuck on a program, getting unstuck
can take quite a while. I've been getting better at training them to know when they've been
stuck "too long" and that they should come talk to me.

On the other hand, perhaps more than any other field, computing requires professionals to be 
self-taught. The half-life of your average programming technology is only 18 months to 2 years. 
If a person can't develop the ability to teach themselves a new language or framework, then 
this is probably not a field that they would enjoy. Knowlege is extremely volatile. I am now
teaching courses on things like mobile apps and progressive web apps that really didn't exist when
I graduated from grad school 10 years ago!

In summary, there are definitely times when student have been right to complain that they need 
more timely feedback from me. Other times, I haven't been doing a good job at setting expectations
about when and how they should be more self-directed than in other classes. This kind of 
comment has been getting less frequent in more recent semesters as I've created more streamlined
processes for being notified about when there are assignments waiting for feedback.

## Summary




I **_value feedback from students greatly_**, and identifying useful and effective mechanisms for student evaluations has long been a cornerstone of my research (see the [description of courseware I've developed](/teaching/courseware.md)) and my service to ISAT (most recently, as an 11-year member of the Assessment Committee which I now chair, and member of the ISAT Student Evaluation of Teaching (SET) Task Force). As a consequence, I have relied upon mechanisms other than the standard ISAT end-of-course evaluations to continuously improve my teaching practice, and so **this section will present markedly different information that you will see from other members of the ISAT faculty**.

Even though the SET Task Force has only started to present its findings to the faculty this academic year, I have been engaged in the preliminary work for this committee for several years.  I am extremely knowledgeable and sought out for my expertise (see the [section on course evaluation-related committees on which I serve](/service/course_evals.md)) with respect to course evaluation. Because I have long been a loud critic of the course evaluation instrument that has been used in ISAT for such a long time, I have also been working diligently to investigate alternatives since Fall 2011.

* Between Fall 2011 and Spring 2016, I:
    * held a one-on-one exit interview with **_every_** student in **_every_** section I taught that semester (sometimes that meant scheduling over 80 interviews during exam week!) 
    * Had each student write a 3-5 page "exit essay" or narrative which asked them to think critically about their learning experience
    * Used the narratives to extract key features about the ISAT student learning experience, which has directly contributed to the work of the SET Task Force
* In Fall 2016 and Spring 2017, I adopted a points-accumulation approach to provide a recent contrast with the CYOG method I have been working on for years, and the written narratives and exit interviews were briefly disbanded. 
* Although the analysis below focuses on qualitative data from the 704 narratives I received and exit interviews I have conducted since Fall 2011, my standard ISAT end-of-course evaluations are available for your perusal if you would like supplemental information.

![Number of student narratives reviewed by Morgan C. Benton](/assets/num-narratives.jpg)

For the remainder of this section, I will describe key themes that have come up repeatedly in my course sections, particularly as relates to the [many iterations of CYOG](/teaching/cyog.md) that I attempted. I will use quotations from the student essays to illustrate and highlight those themes, and I will discuss my responses to student feedback, and if possible, the student responses to my responses. But first:

## A Comment on Numeric Course Evaluations

I am known across campus as an expert in pedagogy and course evaluation and am sought after to participate in and lead groups of faculty like the [Faculty Senate Academic Policies Committee and task forces on academic rigor and course evaluation, both at the departmental and university level](/service/course_evals.md). I am asked to present on these topics at [national and international conferences](/scholarship/international.md). I am invited to be a part of new and progressive educational initiatives internationally like:

* the Burning Man Educators Symposium in Napa, 
* the First International Conference on Seasteading in French Polynesia, and
* as educational partner for Digital Raign, an organization which hopes to harness the power of virtual reality and augmented reality for economic and social empowerment.

That being said, the numeric scores that I received from students are fine. Sometimes they are above departmental averages, sometimes below, but there is no case in which my scores were a cause for alarm, or even concern. I do not put much stock in them, and by and large have not received much or any actionable guidance from them. The most valuable part of them was the written comments students made, but I got MUCH more information from the exit narratives that I will describe below.

If you would like to see the more recent evaluations, you may access the scanned copies maintained by the ISAT Department, and/or I will make available most of the original hard-copy evaluation documents.

My historical evaluations are downloadable from the website I prepared for my promotion to associate and tenure application:

* [Scanned copies of ALL ISAT course evaluations prior to Fall 2011](http://tenure.umatter2.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CourseEvals.zip)
* [Scanned copies of my course evaluation summaries from 2001-2005 when I taught at New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://tenure.umatter2.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/AllNJITTeachingEvaluations.pdf)

## End-of-Semester Narratives

For most of the semesters since 2011, I have solicited an end-of-semester narrative from all of my students. The students brought me a hard copy of the narrative and we had a one-on-one exit interview that lasted between 15 and 60 minutes, usually around 25 minutes. The interviews were (almost always) relaxed and friendly, and contained a balance of me providing feedback to the student, and the student providing feedback to me. Here is a sample of an email I used to solicit the end-of-semester narrative:

### Email Soliciting End-of-Semester Narrative

> Hello All,

> It is time to set up our end-of-semester exit interviews. Interviews will take place between 9AM and 5PM on Tuesday and Wednesday 12/13 and 12/14. <span style="background-color:yellow;">**I will have a signup sheet in class on Friday 12/9. Those who show up to class will get first dibs on an interview time slot.**</span>

> Your interview will be relaxed and friendly. <span style="background-color:yellow;">**I would like you to bring a PRINTED copy of your end-of-semester narrative essay**</span>. Here are the questions I would like you to address:
* What were your expectations coming into this class?
What learning goals did you set for yourself?
How did your goals evolve over the course of the semester? 
* In what ways did you feel you were successful?  Please refer to specific, concrete artifacts that would serve as evidence of your successes. 
In what areas do you feel you failed to achieve your goals?  
* Please reflect on what you think you've learned from your failures, and what, if any, plans you have to address those issues in the future. 
* JMU's Mission Statement is to produce "educated and enlightened citizens who lead meaningful and productive lives."  Do you feel more educated?  More enlightened?  Less so? 
* How have your activities this semester contributed or detracted from your knowing yourself better and having a better grasp on what you want to do in the near or distant future? 
* How did this style of course work for you?  
* If you were to take it again what would you recommend that I do it the same or differently? 
* What grade would you like for me to report to the registrar for you, and why? 

> The goal of this narrative is to give you an opportunity to do some deep reflection.  Take it seriously.  Take a good, long, hard look in the mirror.  Have fun with it.  I expect that doing a good job of this will probably mean that you'll write somewhere in the 3-5 page range (single spaced).

> Thank you for a great semester, and I hope to see many of you in 345/348 next fall!

> Cheers,
Morgan

Sometimes these emails asked specific questions about a new feature of my pedagogy that I was trying out. Below is a summary, in no particular order of some common themes that came out of these essays.

### Expressions of Fear and Trepidation

It was common for students to express fear or nervousness about their ability to be successful in a class. Here is a very typical statement from a student:

> Coming into this class ... I was honest really nervous because I am still not comfortable with coding. I have taken [some some other coding classes], however, coding is still very new to me.... I felt like I would be in over my head....

I saw this kind of expression over and over again. In response, I went to great lengths to drive out fear, and make students feel welcome and comfortable in the class. I worked to make them feel that class was an opportunity, and not a chore. As a result, the student above went on to say:

> Morgan has such a great way of approaching the teaching and learning process, that being scared or nervous for this class just seemed stupid. ... Comparing our skills to other classmates was not an option. We needed to do a project that would benefit us, and reflect our own personal strengths and gifts.

This particular student teamed up with a classmate and built a fully functioning online store where they sold blue jean shorts that they had decorated. It was pretty impressive to see that happen in a single semester.

### Love/Hate for the Amount of Freedom

Since there are no requirements with [CYOG](/teaching/cyog.md), students had A LOT of freedom to decide how they would spend their time during a semester. Some students thrived in this atmosphere:

> I was very surprised when I walked in and I was told to pick my own project. I had no idea what to do since I was never given this opportunity before so at first I still tried to do a regular project that I thought you as the professor wanted to see. Then when [another student] said he wanted to create a game and it was considered an appropriate project, I knew that's what I was going to do.

These students teamed up and built a fully immersive 3D software model of the ISAT building and populated it with zombies. This student later submitted the game to the [Dream it. Code it. Win it.](https://dreamitcodeitwinit.wordpress.com/) contest. She didn't win, but she did use the game she'd written to show off her skills to potential employers. Not everyone handled the freedom well, however. 

> Knowing that I didn't have to worry about failing the class since I get to choose my own grade made me procrastinate work for this class on more than one occasion. Not having deadlines meant that I could play video games with my friends at night instead of learning more about coding in JavaScript....

And from another student:

> Unfortunately, the style of teaching in the class didn't resonate with me. I feel like I very much need structure in order to succeed. There were points in the beginning of the year that I felt so lost.

A very consistent message from students was that I didn't provide enough "structure." This puzzled me since my [syllabi](/supporting_materials/syllabi.md) were **very** detailed and gave pretty clear guidelines for how to spend their time. What I discovered in the interviews and essays was that when students say "structure" what they meant was "tell me what to do so I don't have to figure it out for myself."

### Students Paid More Attention to Health and Well-being

When you can't use grades to make students do the work, you have to spend a lot more time getting to know them personally, to find out what makes them tick, to help clear away the obstacles that are standing in the way of their learning. It was this intense listening that helped me realize the dire need for students to pay more attention to their bodies and their hearts. From one student:

> I consistently stress myself out to be the perfect student, but I don't enjoy everything I do. I've been working constantly at the expense of my health in hopes it will benefit me some way in the future. My hair has thinned. I haven't been eating healthy.... I think I need to start figuring out what **_I'm_** intensely passionate about and put my effort into that.

And from another:

> This semester was honestly a little rough for me. I had a lot of personal things going on and combined with school I felt like honestly dropping out. It was during the cell phone project that I decided not to, though. ...during that time I thought long and hard about everything and decided that I had come this far and that I wasn't going to let any of the bullshit stop me.

One of my explicit goals was to help students discover their own innate passion for learning. Doing this required [developing a habit of mindfulness](http://www.ellenlanger.com/books/3/mindfulness). I spent time in the class teaching students to meditate, and creating assignments that forced them to unplug their technology, turn off their cell phones, and just be with themselves for a while.

### Sometimes the Motivational Theories Worked

By removing extrinsic motivation (i.e. grades) from the course, it freed students up to learn just for the sake of learning. Some students said things like:

> I can't remember the last time I pursued assigned school work with such an attitude.

Or:

> I don't remember the last time I had this much fun working on a project for a class... The lack of deadlines or tests to regurgitate information made a much better atmosphere.

This was NOT a majority of the students. More often than not, there was something (internal or external) that prevented them from getting to this level of relaxation and enjoyment. This leads to the next theme.

### Students Realized How Much Grades were a Motivational Crutch

A large number of the exit interviews contained a passage that said something like:

> The most important lesson I believe I learned from this class, which to me may also be the most important less I learned this semester, is one of two things: I either need to have more structure in my education, or I definitely need to take this opportunity to improve my discipline to follow through with the expectations and goals I set for myself. ... I've spent all semester thinking about the kind of man I want to be, and disciplined and hard-working are pretty high up there...

Students frequently referred to themselves as procrastinators, but in the end they usually went pretty easy on themselves. You could tell from reading their essays that:

* they felt like they had been given a lot of freedom,
* that they had been strongly encouraged to take advantage of it,
* that they knew that they had NOT done so,
* that there was nobody to blame for this but themselves, but
* they found someone else to blame for it anyway

Many seemed to become more aware of the forces that kept them performing in their classes.

### They Knew They Didn't "Deserve" an A But Asked for an A Anyway

It was not uncommon to see something like this:

> I would like to leave you with this about me. I am not a bad person for choosing an A in this class. I am simply abiding by your policy and that is the grade I want you to report to the registrar. I also do not want you to think I am a dishonest person. It would be a lie for myself to tell you about all the things I have learned in your class besides the history of computers. ... Sure I had  plethora of injuries, struggles with my personal life, and questioning of who I am, but that is by no means the only reason I didn't show up. I do not want you to think I am a bad person for not showing up...

For these students, I wanted them to have to make this kind of argument on paper, and face-to-face. The discrepancy between asking for the grade they wanted (usually an A) and feeling that they deserved something lower was uncomfortable. When I first started doing CYOG, this was a relatively small number of students. As time went on though, the number grew. Until...

### The Straw that Broke CYOG's Back

I finally had to come to the conclusion that while there were a lot of interesting and beneficial facets to CYOG, it was not serving students well, and I needed to come up with something different. The [entire email thread](https://github.com/morphatic/sis-portfolio/raw/master/supporting_materials/misc/2015--Frattaroli--ConversationAboutSkippingClasses.pdf) is worth a read, but in a nutshell, I had a student tell me I was "the most intriguing/interesting professor I've ever had" and then tell me he was not coming to class, ever. He was completely honest about it in his exit essay:

> I wasted a spot in your class that may have been used by someone who needs it. I wasted your time that you spent designing course work for your students. I abused your policies. I disrespected your hard work and I added negative energy in your life that was unnecessary.

Essentially, he stayed in my class because it allowed him to focus more time on his other classes, and then he used the good grades to successfully compete for an internship. (I feel compelled to divulge that he was a business major.)

His approach was crass and cynically pragmatic, but given his professed goals **it was hard not to agree with him that he had made the most sensible choice**. When it became clear to me that we are caught in a system where the "sensible" thing is NOT to do the things you'd find most meaningful and enjoyable. At this point, I decided that CYOG was no longer serving students' needs as best it could.

I should be clear that I don't think there's anything wrong with CYOG, per se. I think about it the same way that Churchill thought about democracy, as the worst way to grade students, except for all of the other ways that have been tried. I think it could work in an atmosphere where I was not the only person teaching a class that way. I think if everyone were doing it, our time would be spent very differently and we would accomplish astounding things that we haven't even dreamed of yet.

## Summary of What I Learned from Exit Essays and Interviews

I am a HUGE fan of collecting feedback this way. The conversations I had with students ranged far beyond the content of the course, and it really gave me the opportunity to personalize and contextualize the course content for each individual student. It is impossible to sit in all of those meetings, and read all of those essays, and not realize what a profound responsibility you have to work to design the most incredible learning experience you can possibly muster. I feel a deep sense of obligation to my students. It is out of love and respect that I continue to innovate in course delivery and assessment. I am truly grateful to have had the freedom and opportunity to work in the way that feels most authentic to me. And the final part of this section will demonstrate why I feel so fortunate.

## Expressions of Gratitude from Students

Here are some examples of students' expression of gratitude for the experience they had in my class. These are the kinds of things that really make your job worthwhile!

### A Post-Graduation Thank-you Note

This is from one of my capstone students who took all of my classes and with whom I published a paper based on her capstone work. I met her when she was still in high school. When I met her, she was driven, but anxious to be told she was doing the "right" thing. She got really upset with me around sophomore year when I wouldn't give her direction anymore. She responded by taking charge of her studies, adding a second major (in SMAD), and turning out probably the best capstone I've ever seen.

> Morgan,

> Giving me permission to take 252 early in college transformed my JMU experience. You made coding accessible to me, because you let me hold the reins to my education. Not everyone appreciates this control because they want to take the easiest route. However, I know it helped me grow and allowed me to discover my passion for UX design. I hope to let others carver their own paths. It is the best way to function as a lifelong learner. I know you'll continue to impact others just as you did for me. We'll be talking.

> Best wishes,
C., ISAT/SMAD '15

### From the "Worst" Student in the Class

> Morgan, your passion for teaching and enthusiasm for students is unparalleled.  You not only inspired me to rethink how I look at college but the way you carry yourself has helped me mature so much this spring semester.  Whenever I brought up something [of only tangential relation to the topic] such as Candide, or the Washington Capitals you were always up beat and were into it.  After spending an entire semester with you I know that is your genuine personality and I strive to be like that.

This student was paying his own way through school and stopped attending class midway through the semester.  I became worried about him when his roommate related to me that he was skipping his other classes and spending all of his time playing video games.  As a result of that, I went to visit him at his house one evening with my TA.  He explained to me that up until this point his attitude had been that since he was paying his own way through school, that he’d spend his time however he wanted to, even if that meant skipping classes and drinking too much.  That sets up the context for his next comment:

> When you came to my house to see how I was doing, that really changed things for me.  I still thought the same about programming [he "despised" it] but it made me realize how genuine you were and how much you cared, and it made me realize how much I missed listening to you in class when you give advice about previous and current experiences in your life….  Another huge thank you I have to give you is getting me really pumped up to do my senior thesis project.  Before it was a means to an end, but now it is something I am really ready to dive into to make a part of my college experience.

### Confessions of an Over-Achiever

The next student was at the opposite end of the spectrum–a chronic overachiever–a **quadruple** major who routinely took around 26 credit hours per semester.  This student only missed my class twice: once to have an emergency root canal, and the other because of an anxiety attack related to a physics exam she had that day.  In her end of semester narrative she said:

> I have always lived my life according to one saying: You are what you do; therefore, excellence is not an act, but a habit.  I work hard because all I want from life is to be respected.  And this does not mean that I will always be liked because I do have a habit of going against societal norms and embracing my ideals whether popular or not.  But because I act on what I believe and because I am true to those beliefs, I will gain respect in the long run.  Furthermore, my hard work has always been reinforced by the grade a professor gives me.  But along with this “reward,” I also believe there is a hidden punishment.  The grades come with expectations.  Before college, I was an average student with many extracurricular activities.  Now, I focus the majority of my energy into my academic work and my GPA reflects that.  The pressure to maintain that average is almost unbearable, but I remain sane because I am not obsessed about the number, but rather I am obsessed with excellence and potential.  Your class has proven to me that I can strive for excellence even without the grade on the line.

In a personal letter she wrote to me after the semester she went on to say:

> I feel that my obsession with approval and excellence has become detrimental to my health and self worth because of the emphasis on the grade.  Even at the end of this semester my body and mind are in knots in the anticipation of the final judgment that will be passed on me by my professors.  And this judgment allots so much power over me....  Your guidance has helped me see, again, the difference between excellence and perfection in grades.

A few semesters later, when this student got her first B ever in a college class, she made a point of coming to me to let me know that she was not upset by it because she felt she had done her best in the class that semester.  Perfection was no longer something she struggled with quite as much.

## The Last Word

I don't know how else to convey to what degree I take this calling seriously. I was truly inspired by some of my professors as a student. It was out of some profound sense of patience and kindness that I feel like I was able to get through college. I feel it is my duty to work as hard as I can to come up with the most effective learning experience possible for every one of my students. I hope that the above will convince you that I listen intensely to what students have to say, and I'm willing to take big risks to achieve the best outcomes for them.
