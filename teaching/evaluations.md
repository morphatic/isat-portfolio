# Evaluations by Students

I am [extremely knowledgeable and sought out for my expertise](/service/course_evals.md) with respect to course evaluation. I have long been a loud critic of the course evaluation instrument that has been used in ISAT for such a long time. I value student feedback greatly which is why for most semesters since 2011:

* I have had a one-on-one exit interview with **_every_** student in **_every_** section I taught that semester (sometimes that meant scheduling over 80 interviews during exam week!) 
* I had each student write a 3-5 page "exit essay" or narrative which asked them to think critically about their learning experience

In this section, I will describe key themes that have come up repeatedly in my course sections, particularly as relates to the [many iterations of CYOG](/teaching/cyog.md) that I attempted. I will use quotations from the student essays to illustrate and highlight those themes, and I will discuss my responses to student feedback, and if possible, the student responses to my responses. But first:

## A Comment on Numeric Course Evaluations

The numeric scores that I received from students are fine. Sometimes they are above departmental averages, sometimes below, but there is no case in which my scores were a cause for alarm, or even concern. I do not put much stock in them, and by and large have not received much or any actionable guidance from them. The most valuable part of them was the written comments students made, but I got MUCH more information from the exit narratives that I will describe below.

If you would like to see them, here are:

* [Scanned copies of ALL ISAT course evaluations prior to Fall 2011](http://tenure.umatter2.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/CourseEvals.zip)
* [Scanned copies of my course evaluation summaries from 2001-2005 when I taught at New Jersey Institute of Technology](http://tenure.umatter2.us/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/AllNJITTeachingEvaluations.pdf)

If you would like to see the more recent evaluations, you may access the scanned copies maintained by the ISAT Department, and/or I will make available most of the original evaluation documents.

## End-of-Semester Narratives

For most of the semesters since 2011, I have solicited an end-of-semester narrative from all of my students. The students brought me a hard copy of the narrative and we had a one-on-one exit interview that lasted between 15 and 60 minutes, usually around 25 minutes. The interviews were (almost always) relaxed and friendly, and contained a balance of me providing feedback to the student, and the student providing feedback to me. Here is a sample of an email I used to solicit the end-of-semester narrative:

### Email Soliciting End-of-Semester Narrative

> Hello All,

> It is time to set up our end-of-semester exit interviews. Interviews will take place between 9AM and 5PM on Tuesday and Wednesday 12/13 and 12/14. <span style="background-color:yellow;">**I will have a signup sheet in class on Friday 12/9. Those who show up to class will get first dibs on an interview time slot.**</span>

> Your interview will be relaxed and friendly. <span style="background-color:yellow;">**I would like you to bring a PRINTED copy of your end-of-semester narrative essay**</span>. Here are the questions I would like you to address:
* What were your expectations coming into this class?
What learning goals did you set for yourself?
How did your goals evolve over the course of the semester? 
* In what ways did you feel you were successful?  Please refer to specific, concrete artifacts that would serve as evidence of your successes. 
In what areas do you feel you failed to achieve your goals?  
* Please reflect on what you think you've learned from your failures, and what, if any, plans you have to address those issues in the future. 
* JMU's Mission Statement is to produce "educated and enlightened citizens who lead meaningful and productive lives."  Do you feel more educated?  More enlightened?  Less so? 
* How have your activities this semester contributed or detracted from your knowing yourself better and having a better grasp on what you want to do in the near or distant future? 
* How did this style of course work for you?  
* If you were to take it again what would you recommend that I do it the same or differently? 
* What grade would you like for me to report to the registrar for you, and why? 

> The goal of this narrative is to give you an opportunity to do some deep reflection.  Take it seriously.  Take a good, long, hard look in the mirror.  Have fun with it.  I expect that doing a good job of this will probably mean that you'll write somewhere in the 3-5 page range (single spaced).

> Thank you for a great semester, and I hope to see many of you in 345/348 next fall!

> Cheers,
Morgan

> Morgan,

> Giving me permission to take 252 early in college transformed my JMU experience. You made coding accessible to me, because you let me hold the reins to my education. Not everyone appreciates this control because they want to take the easiest route. However, I know it helped me grow and allowed me to discover my passion for UX design. I hope to let others carver their own paths. It is the best way to function as a lifelong learner. I know you'll continue to impact others just as you did for me. We'll be talking.

> Best wishes,
Cassidy, ISAT/SMAD '15
