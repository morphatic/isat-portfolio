# End-of-Semester Narratives

From Fall 2011 to Spring 2016, I:

* Held a one-on-one exit interview with **each** student in **each** section I taught that semester
* Conducted over 700 interviews in total, with more than 80 interviews in some semesters
* Collected 3-5 page narrative exit essays from each student prior to the interviews
* Amassed over 1000 pages of student narratives on their course experiences ([downloadable here](/supporting_materials/evals.md))
