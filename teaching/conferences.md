# Educational/Pedagogical Conferences

Participating and/or presenting in conferences and workshops focused primarily on teaching is a regular part of what I do. Here is a list of some of those in which I've participated. If I presented, there is a link to my slides.

* **CFI Workshop: Getting to Know Your Classroom Climate**<br>I co-led this in the fall 2010 semester with Laura Haas, from Career and Academic Planning. This was the culmination of the CFI Madison Teaching Fellows program that I participated in with Laura, and Bob Brown of the Religion Department during the 2009-10 academic year.
