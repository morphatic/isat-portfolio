# Custom Courseware

When it comes to educational technology, my guiding metaphor is:

> **To keep my finger on the pulse of the class.**

Different students have different needs. My goal as an instructor is to be able to make every student feel like they're getting one-on-one attention.

I have spent a great deal of time writing software to achieve this goal. On this page I'll describe some of the features that I think are significant.

## Personal Profiles

Each student in my class has a personal profile page that has their photo, contact information, and also information about their progress in the course:

Students were in control of what contact information they shared with the class, and the profile pages are **only** available to class members who have logged into the course website. One of my explicit goals has always been to foster connections between members of the learning community.

## Have I Read This?

On all of the important pages on the site, in the upper-righthand corner of the page is a button that gives students the opportunity to convey to the instructor and other classmates that they have, in fact, read a particular page:

After clicking the button, the interface changes to display a "Thank you!" In addition, by clicking the "Show Readers" link, a list of everyone in the course who has (and has not) read the page is displayed:

This is a subtle bit of peer pressure designed to foster a desire to be part of the "cool kids" club (who has read the content on the website).

This widget also serves as insurance for the instructor so that if a student doesn't meet expectations, they can't claim not to have read the course content.

On each person's profile page is a list of all of the pages they have read:

There is also a list of "Pages I Haven't Read" which gives the instructor a quick way to see the list of either:

* People who haven't read a particular page
* All of the pages a particular person hasn't read

On the instructor dashboard, there is also a list which shows which students are delinquent in their reading. This is one of the clues that I use as instructor to know when a student is falling behind and may need some additional attention from me.

Again, the goal is not to play "gotcha," but rather to have an "early warning system" that will help me prevent students from falling through the cracks.

## Do I Want To Learn This?

Another feature of my courseware is a widget that allows students to express interest in learning a particular topic, and also to see all of the other students who also have expressed an interest in that topic:

Once a student has adopted an objective, the button turns into a progress bar that the student can then update as they reach various stages of learning for that topic:

There are five levels of learning with a common interpretation:

<ol start='0'><li>I haven't started learning this yet</li><li>I have followed a basic tutorial or read some basic information</li><li>I have used the information from the reading or tutorial to produce a **new** artifact</li><li>I have gotten feedback on my artifact from other students, and I have given feedback to them on their artifacts</li><li>I have taught someone how to do this thing, or created a tutorial of my own for others to follow</li></ol>
