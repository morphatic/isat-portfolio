# Morphatic--My Blog

In late 2015, I resurrected my blog. Since then I've written about 20 posts, and developed regular traffic yielding about 100 visits per day, or 3000 per month. My more popular posts are tutorials like:

* [Super-fast Secure WordPress Install on DigitalOcean with NGINX, PHP7, and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS](http://www.morphatic.com/2016/05/21/super-fast-secure-wordpress-install-on-digitalocean-with-nginx-php7-and-ubuntu-16-04-lts/)
* [Creating a Filter Pipe for Angular 2 (in Ionic 2)](http://www.morphatic.com/2016/06/23/creating-a-filter-pipe-for-angular-2-in-ionic-2/)

People also seem to like my series of blog posts on [building a DIY bubble tube](http://www.morphatic.com/2016/04/27/diy-led-bubble-tube-part-6-first-test/). I've used this series to get students excited about building IoT (internet-of-things) projects in JMU's XLabs.

I like writing the blog because it helps me solidify my understanding of new and cutting edge topics in programming and web development, and also because it allows me to share that with my students and also get some external validation from the world.
