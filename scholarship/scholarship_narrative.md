# A Calling Emerges: My Scholarship Narrative

I have a very active learn-life. The majority of my research boils down to three main areas:

* Innovations to pedagogy and course evaluation, frequently supported by technology, e.g. in the area of STEM to STEAM (STEM + Arts)
* Social implications of new technologies such as IoT (Internet of Things), VR/AR (virtual reality/augmented reality), machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence), cryptocurrency (e.g. bitcoin)
* Student-led collaborations, usually in the form of capstone projects

I am passionate about these things, and have enjoyed the increasing ability to discover new things and have new impacts that comes with the maturation of an academic career.

## Scholarship By the Numbers

I joined the New Jersey Institute of Technology faculty as a graduate student in 2001, joined the JMU ISAT department in 2006, and earned my Ph.D. officially in 2008. Depending on how you count it, I've had an academic career that has lasted between 9 and 16 years. During the course of that time I have authored or co-authored:

* 12 refereed journal articles, 
* 11 conference papers or presentations, 
* 6 book reviews, 
* 2 published book chapters, 
* 2 unpublished book chapters, and 
* numerous blog posts (over 30 at present count)

I have been PI, Co-PI, or the recipient of:

* 11 funded projects or grants totaling over $640,000
* 8 unsuccessful funding proposals that, if awarded, would have totaled over $2.2 million.

I have a total of roughly 56 citations of my work. So on average, I have published 2-3 refereed publications per year, been cited 3-4 times per year, and have 1-2 funding requests per year, with a success rate of $640K out of a total possible $2.8 million, or about 22% success rate by dollar amount.

In short, I believe I have a very active and successful track record as a scholar.
